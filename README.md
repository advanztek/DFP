# DFP (Drone Flight Planner)

## Project Overview
**DFP (Drone Flight Planner)** is a mission planning software designed for drone operators to input specific drone data (e.g., max flight time, speed) and receive optimized flight plans with success rate predictions. This project was developed as part of my degree requirement at the **Airforce Institute of Technology (AFIT), Kaduna, Nigeria**.

## Features
- Input critical drone specifications such as maximum flight time, speed, and payload capacity.
- Generate optimized flight plans based on user input and real-time environmental data.
- Success rate predictions based on drone capabilities and mission parameters.
- Intuitive user interface developed using **React** and **Vite.js**.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React, Vite.js
- **Backend**: Node.js (for processing and generating flight plans)
- **APIs**: Integration with weather services for real-time data

## How to Install and Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dfp.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd dfp
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage
1. Input drone data such as max flight time, speed, and payload.
2. Receive a generated flight plan optimized for battery life, speed, and distance.
3. View the estimated success rate based on environmental conditions and drone capabilities.
